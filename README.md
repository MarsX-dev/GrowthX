# NameInserter
A Chrome extension for X (ex. Twitter) power users.

GrowthX adds their name as you reply on X.com. Simple and useful.


Why put names?
If you call your followers by name, they will like you more. Build more quality connections by using the extension.

Why use this?
You can put the names manually. But why doing so if you have a computer? Let the machine do the boring job.


How much time will it save me?
Here is the math:
- 5 seconds per reply
- 20 replies per day
- 20 days per month
- 33 mins per month = 6.6 hours per year
- 396 hours of your entire life

# How to use
